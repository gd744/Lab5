"""
This application will be translating a sentence based on user inputs.
A text file will be read, and then a list of strings will be created within the file.
The captured list is then compared to a dictionary.

We will be defining a function that splits a user's input into a set of strings
A loop will then run through the array of strings and match the word with the translation dictionary.

The full translated set will be print to the user.
